# todo-list-react

Created a productivity application using React, enabling users to manage their tasks and to-do lists efficiently. The app includes essential features like adding, deleting, and editing notes or tasks. The application leverages the power of React hooks, such as useState and useEffect, to manage the state and lifecycle of components effectively. Additionally, local storage has been incorporated, granting users seamless access to their notes anytime, even if they close or reopen the application. This seamless data persistence ensures that users' progress and task lists are preserved across sessions, enhancing their productivity and task management experience.
